            <p>SVM aims to be a embeddable JVM. It doesn't do much, but you can integrate it
            for some functionality. The goal is to eventually support Java SE 17. Steps have
            been taken so that SVM can run on any platform that supports the C standard library,
            and it's written with no external dependencies. It builds fast, and is easy
            to integrate into your application, with almost everything documented. Please
            keep in mind that the reference binary is not compliant with the standard JVM
            options/flags/arguments, so you can't use this as a replacement for OpenJDK or
            whatnot.</p>
            <p>SVM does not offer online documentation; instead, please build SVM with
            documentation support. The documentation is generated with <a href="https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html">Doxygen</a>, so if
            you wanted to you could just build it directly.</p>
            <p>PRs are entirely welcome. While I don't anticipate this becoming anything
            of large importance, I want to build something that is at least somewhat
            usable, and that can be embedded inside an application. The lack of platform
            dependencies makes it easy to compile this for a huge amount of systems.
            About 2 different system calls are used (on Linux and MacOS), and that's just
            for dynamic allocation. That's how portable SVM is.</p>
