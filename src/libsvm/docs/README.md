# SVM
Welcome to the SVM documentation! There's a lot of sightseeing to do. You may have to venture off the beaten path, however, as not everything is documented :/

SVM uses only C99 standard headers and platform independent code, so it should work wherever you might find a C compiler that supports C99. If not, please support an issue.

This project uses the [Oracle's Java SE 17 JVM Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se17/jvms17.pdf) as reference.

SVM comes in a library and the binary. The binary is just a simple front end for the library. This documentation page only covers the library. The binary doesn't need much fleshed out documentation, only comments.
